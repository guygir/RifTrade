## 🎮 Game Summary (Quick Reference)

**Core Concept**: A roguelike basketball management game where you manage a team through 14-week seasons (11 regular + 3 playoff weeks).

**Key Mechanics**:
- **Player Stats**: 6 attributes in hexagon (Outside/Inside Offense/Defense, Passing, Athleticism)
- **Weekly Actions**: 3 actions per week (training, buying/selling players, tactics, skills, infrastructure)
- **Game Simulation**: Play vs AI teams each week
- **Aging System**: Players age 18→21, retire at 21, draft new 18-year-olds
- **Progression**: Unlock skills, tactics, and bonuses that persist across seasons
- **Victory**: Win the championship to beat the game, or restart with progression

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
